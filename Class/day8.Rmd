## During class


### Election 2018

The file `Class_files/2018_R_per_kommun.csv` contains the results of the Swedish elections for *Riksdagen* in Swedish municipalities from [valmyndigheten](https://data.val.se/val/val2018/statistik/index.html#slutligt). Extract the columns containing results for the main 7 parties (columns 5-12), rescale this matrix using `scale` and call the result `X`.

- Compute the principal components of `X` using `princomp` and plot using `biplot`. Which parties seem to be most close/distant to SD in terms of municipal voting patterns?

- Perform hierarchical clustering of both `X` and `t(X)` using `hclust` and plot the resulting object with `plot` (add suitable labels for the former using `labels`-option in `plot`).

- The file `Class_files/Kommungruppsindelning_2017.csv` contains a [classification of Swedish municipalities](https://skl.se/tjanster/kommunerlandsting/faktakommunerochlandsting/kommungruppsindelning.2051.html) ([english translation](https://skl.se/download/18.6b78741215a632d39cbcc85/1487772640274/Classification%20of%20Swedish%20Municipalities%202017.pdf)). Join this with the election data (paste the first two columns of election data for a matching key). 

- Compute the singular value decomposition of `X` and extract the first two columns of the *U* matrix. Add these columns to the joined table above and plot them as points colored by the classification of municipalities. Does there seem to be a relation between voting patterns and classification (or do the points seem colored randomly)?


### 6 graders

In the file `Class_files/betyg.csv` you will find the average grade of 6 graders in a number of subjects and municipalities. Explore data using multivariate techniques.
