## Do this before class

Read [R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) chapter 28. Claus Wilke's [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) is a highly recommended text on visualisation, with beautiful `ggplot2` graphics (code available [here](https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz)).

## During class

There will be a lecture followed by the chance to discuss projects or general class/homework supervision.
